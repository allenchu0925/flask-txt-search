本尊道第 100 集 意識流

（感恩本尊）
不用跪，不用跪
（本尊好）霍醫師
（終於見到您了）Nat, Mr.Nat
坐這樣子啊，這位子還不錯
要發表什麼？
先講一下
（Nat：Is it on now?） yeah.
（Nat：Okay, should I just go and）
（you translate it, okay.）Yeah.
（Nat：So, one of the reasons I thought）
（it was really important that we）
（Nat：be here today is that we're at a really）
（important moment in physics.）
（Nat：You can translate first.）
要不然霍醫生你來…
（他說他現在這個…）
（他說他們在這裡，就是非常重要）
（在物理學上是非常重要的）
（對，是這樣子）
（Nat：So, one hundred years ago）
（when quantum mechanics began,）
（Nat：there were many physicists who thought）
（that consciousness was more important）
（Nat：than everything, but they were viewed）
（as kind of the outsiders.）Yeah.
（Nat：Now, that's not the case anymore）
（Nat：The last two Nobel）
（ I don't want to say too much）
（Nat：to let you translate it.）
（本尊，他說在一百年前）
（quantum physics 就是量子力學）
（當時在討論的時候，被認為是）
（不入流的，但是現在已經被證明說）
（意識會影響物理學）
（Nat：But, now with the Nobel Prize in 2021）
and the Nobel Prize in 2022. First one to）
（Nat：Roger Penrose, the second one）
（to Anton Zeilinger）
（Nat：that thinking is now mainstream. So now）
（with a combination of those two prizes,）
（Nat：everyone all physicists）
（now agree consciousness）
（Nat：is more important than matter.）
（Consciousness precedes matter）
（Nat：and consciousness creates matter.）
（所以就…那個）
（這陣子諾貝爾2021）
（還有2022的得主）
（他們都是跟物理學，然後跟意識有相關）
（所以consciousness就是意識）
（它可以改變物質）
（創造物質跟影響物質）
（他現在講的就是說，現在的）
（quantum physics已經到達這樣子）
（可以改變、創造物質）
（跟我們的意識息息相關）就是我們現在談的這些
Ben-Zun say this is the topic we are
discussing about.（Nat：Exactly.）Oh, yeah.
（Nat：But the question is, the）
（question is, is no one quite understands）
（Nat：exactly how consciousness and the light）
（are related. So, does consciousness create）
（Nat：the light which is a form of matter, or）
（is consciousness actually the light）
（Nat：is consciousness carried by light, so）
（we're talking so much about the light right?）
（Nat：We're talking about the Spiral Light,）
（we're talking about the Great Sun,）
（Nat：so when we're talking about）
（ that vis-à-vis our the consciousness,）
（Nat：are there distinctions to make there, or）
（Nat：are these all different ways of saying）
（the same thing?）
（本尊他的意思是說）
（我們今天講到這個）
（那他在想說是我們的意識創造光）
（還是說有提到大日）
（那也有提到漩渦光，那這些東西）
（是我們的意識創造的嗎？）
（那他的…這是他問的問題，還是說）
（祂是怎麼樣存在、怎麼樣的由來這樣）
「光體」，光體是宇宙的光體
不是我們意識創造的
Ben-Zun says... 先跟他解釋
this light, especially the Spiral Light
and the Great Sun, are just there,
At the very beginning of
the universe, there's no reason.
（沒有什麼理由存在）
沒有什麼…因為我小時候
八歲的時候就碰到這個大日
When Ben-Zun was a small kid at
eight years old. Eight years old.
When Ben-Zun was eight years old.
He encountered this light.
我也不知道是什麼
因為我小孩子什麼都不懂
He didn't know the meaning of this light.
然後祂介紹我一切內容，我都不懂
And then, the light tried to introduce
all the contents to Ben-Zun.
When he was a kid...甚至
年輕的時候給我顯相很多照片
二十萬張我也不懂
When people were shooting the pictures
of Ben-Zun.
a lot of lights manifested
in the pictures.
Ben-Zun didn't understand
the meanings and the reasons
why there were so many lights when
someone just took photos for Ben-Zun
and a lot of light bodies just manifested
in the pictures.那就證明不是我的意識
不是人類的意識 This can prove that this is not
Ben-Zun's thinking or Ben-Zun's concepts.
This is something beyond Ben-Zun's
consciousness.（Nat：Yeah.）
因為我年輕什麼都不懂
我怎麼知道還有什麼
Ben-Zun says when...
during that time, he was young
he didn't know anything.
It must be something..
我研究了六十年才知道
Ben-Zun has been trying to find the answers
and doing research for sixty years.
所以才現在很容易的和你…
So,Ben-Zun is now able to introduce to us.
我全部是被動的，是祂賜給我的
眉心放光以後就全部瞭解了
Ben-Zun was passive. Because the light was
doing many things, while Ben-Zun was passive.
Ben-Zun didn't understand.
During one day of the year
the light radiated from
between Ben-Zun's eyebrows
and then Ben-Zun started to
understand everything.
大日 All the language of the light.
所以宇宙的光體是客體
This light body is objective,
not something from our imagination,
那主體，是我們的本心
你自己的意識屬本心
主體涵蓋你的意識，法性和意識
意識是第八意識，是主體
如果你意識創造的就是你的本體了
這個客體不是意識創造
是祂給你知道
你的本體在吸收
祂知道就這樣
他講的意識創造的是主體的本體
表達出來形成識變（好）
The light body is really
objective to us,
it's not something we create or think
from our minds,
but the subjective part
is our original mind.
So, once the light starts to
How can I say... illuminated,
and our original mind encounters the light
and started to get connected or activated.
You're able to create something
by your consciousness.
It's just like the question you
asked before, you said...
“Do we create the light?
Or do we create something?”
But, actually if we want to create
something substantiated,
we need to encounter the light.
Otherwise, it's just imagination.
所以你說意識創造，是指我們的主體
分為主體和客體
那你主體，平常人沒有辦法創造
要碰到光體
祂給你能量，你才能創造
現在創造要遇到光體
所以才「遇斯光」
Ben-Zun said now you guys
are able to create something
because you've encountered the light.
The light is like momentum, and
the material for your consciousness.
Because our consciousness
is like a pattern,
like a module. You just think something,
but, inside we need something to fill in.
So, this light...okay,
the material from the light is able
to make this thing substantiated.
So, that's why you can touch, you can feel.
Subjectively speaking, this contains
your divinity and your consciousness,
but how can we discover our divinity
Because we encounter the light.
the light illuminates, and that's way we can
discover, 'ok, there's the divinity and
there's the pure potential.'
Because we cannot find our pure potential.
Once we encounter the light,
it gets activated.
Otherwise, you will...maybe we try so
hard to find it, through meditation.
But it's very hard,very difficult.
Once you encounter the light,
the light activates your pure potential
and gives you the energy. This light is
basically energy and wisdom.
主體的法性和意識
沒有碰到光體的能量，不能顯發出來
所以很多人修道，修不成
There were so many people tried
so hard to worship
the religions and do some rituals.
But they didn't succeed. Why?
They didn't succeed. Why?
Because they didn't encounter the light.
Because you need that encounter to
have your original mind activated.
So, once you try to achieve the goal, or
understand the meaning of your life,
You need to have your original mind's function,
so you can understand the wisdom,
understand the answer of your life.
比如說很多人這種傳統都苦修
為什麼不能成？不能顯發
不能自見其身？
因為沒有碰到光，沒有能量
所以才有所謂「夜睹明星」
就那個明星使你有能量
這樣很好解釋
Now, Ben-Zun gives a remarkable example
that Buddha was trying so hard
for many years by doing his meditation and
many rituals, but he was not successful.
Once the Buddha saw the bright star
in the night sky,
and then he had an epiphany,
he realized everything. Realized the life.
自古以來，很多人修道、苦修
那個精神很值得佩服
就是沒有成，禪定、苦修，很多人修
可是沒有看到自己
看到自己就是法身，以這個做標準
For example, Ben-Zun says that so many people
are doing meditation
from two thousand years ago, from now on.
So many people are doing meditation,
But they cannot see themselves
just like you say you saw "energy body." If
you can see yourself by doing meditation,
it's already you could see your...
We said "Dharma body," or
"spiritual body," whatever..
You already get your inner
consciousness starts to substantiate.
But it's really difficult and unstable.
You need to have the chance to encounter
the light. This light can make your...
Sorry.（Nat：This...）
（Huo：他的問題就是說…）
（Huo：現在物理學比如說2021年）
（和2022年的物理學那個…）
（Huo：諾貝爾獎，就發給）
（一個是發給Roger Penrose）
（Huo：另一個是）
（Nat：Anton Zeilinger）
（Huo：兩個人他都是講到意識宇宙）
（宇宙意識，他的問題是說）
（Huo：這個意識和這個放光和光）
（究竟是什麼關係？）
他說什麼？意識和放光是什麼關係？
（Huo：對）
（Huo：意識是由光作為載體帶出來的）
（Huo：還是意識是單獨存在的）
兩個要合一
兩個要合一成一體才能放光
意識，剛開始意識要帶動
意識帶動
你因為相應到光的體性了
因為體性相同，所以才能放光
（Huo：對，就是光出來以後）
（Huo：光本身就帶著你的意識出來）
可是你要首先接觸到光（Huo：對）
像你現在接觸到光
有時候接觸到了
祂放光放得出來
（Huo：因為他的意思就是說）
（現在是整個物理學界）
（Huo：大家都在談這個宇宙意識）
（意識宇宙，怎麼找到這個意識）
（Huo：大家都沒有辦法）
意識為主體，是你自己的主體
包括剛才說的法性
法性和意識是你本心的主體
你個人的主體，光是客體
可是祂們的體性一樣
你自己的體性
沒有接觸到光體的體性，你發不出來
所以很少人會放光
（Huo：就是說接觸到光以後）
接到光以後，你就可以放光
（Huo：你再放這光就帶著你的意識）
那你就能放出去
（Huo：這就是他的問題）
（Huo：因為他要研究這個意識）
（和這個光的關係）
要接觸到光，體性要接觸到才能放光
單獨意識，就苦修，你不能放光
放光的話就表示你接觸到光體了
你就能產生種種變化
（本尊，他順便問的）
（就是霍醫生剛有提到）
（就是他是意識帶著光，他現在問的）
（是意識帶著光，還是光帶著意識？）
以這個為前提，就是說
要你接觸到光的體性，才能放光
意識本身不會放光
要接觸到這個光
那個光，你的意識就能帶動祂
（Huo：我明白）
（看我理解的對不對）
（Huo：你先要遇斯光，遇斯光你的意識）
（就能跟那個光的體性結合起來）
（Huo：你可以放出光來）對，就這樣
（Huo：這個光本身就帶著你的意識）
光能融入你的意識的體性
就形成你會放光
像我這樣是意識放出去的（對）
光在後面，祂沒有表達出來
因為你接觸到光的體性
遇到光了，所以你放得出來
意識也可以放光
本身沒有光體的話，不能放光
（Huo：好，感恩本尊）
（Huo：問題就是說）
（現在你接觸的光和你本性和諧）
（Huo：和能放光，這個光是不是含…）
（這光已經出來，離開你的人體了）
（Huo：這光裡是不是還含著你的意識？）
光還含有什麼？
（Huo：光裡面還包含你的意識？）
（堯：就一體了，就是結合一體了）
就是一體，合一
才會說已經一體了
（Huo：這就是他的問題）一體了
（因為你要研究這個意識，你怎麼下手）
意識本身不能放光
（Huo：對）
意識本身可以放光的話
苦修就成了啊
為什麼要強調夜睹明星？
因為他相應到
（Huo：我明白了，要相應到光）
然後體性
（Huo：意識跟光相合以後，才能放光）
（這光裡本身含著你的意識）
光就配合你的意識
不是祂本身含有意識
祂配合你的意識了
因為合為一體
不要把祂分為二
合一了，這叫合一了
（霍醫師麻煩你解釋一下）
（先試試看，我要消化一下）
OK, I need to digest
（use the microphone）簡單的歸納
意識本身不會發光
（Huo：After encountered the light,）
（then your consciousness）
（Huo：can combine with this light,）
（Huo：then you can project the light.）
（Huo：This light is the one of lights）
（and your consciousness.）
usually sometimes because...
Just now Frank asked Ben-Zun
is our consciousness leading the light
or is the light leading
our consciousness to go outside.
But, Ben-Zun said that
once you encountered it. You will get unified.
There is no difference between your
consciousness and this light.
（Nat：Yes, I understand that,）
（but the question really is we're saying）
（Nat：the phrase 'encounter the light'）
（encounter the light）
（Nat：over and over again.）
（Nat：What exactly does that?）
（Encounter the light.）
「遇斯光」是什麼？
（Huo：That's what we're talking about ）
（that light is the origin.）
（Nat：Yeah.）Okay.
（Huo：It's even before the universe formed.）
（Huo：It's never changed. It's always there,）
（never dismissed.）（Nat：Hmm）
（Huo：That's what we're talking about）
（the light, encounter that one.）
It just happens to encounter.
So, when...
When you say the meaning of
encounter the light
in our case, right now,
you guys have encountered the light.
Because you met Frank Huo, and his mind
has already been got lit up.
So he is able to guide you.
Ben-Zun just now explained,
At the beginning your consciousness
cannot emit the light.
Cannot emit the light.
（Nat：What? ）Just from your... cannot
（Huo：Before you haven't encountered）
（the light.）（Nat：Yeah.）
（Huo：Your consciousness cannot be）
（released or become light.）（Nat：Yeah.）
So, you need to have someone who
has got enlightened,
and then you just accept his concepts.
And because this just absorbs
from your consciousness,
there's no physical ritual to say:“okay,
now you have the light,
I gave you the light.”
It's not like this.
Once you accept the concepts,
your consciousness start to
absorb the light,
so we call it
"encounter the light."
Ben-Zun practices like this,
to make your consciousness and the light
interacted more fluently.
Can you understand?
How about... How about
（Nina：Are you saying this light is God?）
（Huo：This is something）
（before the universe formed）
When you see in the Bible,"God says:
'Let there be light, and there was light'"
Once we try to be in God's kingdom,
the first thing we must find out
or realize what the light is?
So, we can understand
How can you prove you see God?
You're in God's kingdom?
Because you've seen the light.
And God said, 'there was light.'
Just like you say, you can see the light.
“Let there be light,
and there was the light.”
You're now approaching God's kingdom.
But we don't say the word “God”
We don't say the word like religions,
but you find your mind.
So, that's why Jesus said
“God is working inside my body
inside my mind”.
So, you find your mind.
But it's very difficult to
find our mind.
We try to meditate and we do some rituals.
Actually, we need to
have some sort of out
light source to lit up
your mind, to activate.
you can find, “oh! I really have a mind,
I can see something there.”
Just like yesterday
I had this kind of example.
If you want to see this cup,
there must be a light,
You have a light bulb or you have sunshine,
so you can see the cup.
And your eyes must be healthy
enough to function to see this cup.
The same thing happens in your universe.
In your spiritual universe.
There must be a light
for you to discover,
to see something, to feel something.
And then your mind vision must
functional enough to see all the stuff.
So far, can you understand?
你講沒有關係，問沒有關係
簡單的說，我再簡單一句
意識本身不會放光（對）
（我們在講這個）是結合光的功能
你看起來好像意識在放光
（Huo：我想請教你這個問題）
（就是在沒有遇到「遇斯光」之前）
（Huo：就說普通的人沒「遇斯光」之前）
（他的意識離不開他的肉體）
（Huo：因為他放不出光來）出離
有時候你還沒有
你不知道你「遇斯光」
可是有時候你的法性接觸到光
你不知道啊
祂沒有表達給你知道
（Huo：我的問題就是，沒有「遇斯光」之前）
（他的意識祂不會出來？）
（Huo：不會出離人體？）
出離人體是法性
法性必須要接觸到光
才能產生功能（（Huo：對，我明白）
祂接觸光，我們肉身不知道
所以有時候
看到你自己出離，說不定有人
看到你分身，可是我不知道
表示你意識沒有知道
（Huo：對，這就是我的問題）
這是你的經驗嘛
（Huo：只要「遇斯光」以後）
（不管你知道不知道，你「遇斯光」了）
（Huo：你的意識就可以放出光來）
（就可以和光合一）
你遇到有時候肉身不知道
五官自我意識不知道
可是五官意識上面有第八意識
五官，五個意識
第六意識、第七意識，還有第八意識
我講我們的意識是指第八意識
第八意識，上面是法性
法性無意中能和…
因為祂們體性一樣，遇到光了
無意中法性流露出身體
流露你自己出離
你自己五官意識不知道
（Huo：那也就是目前這些物理學家）
（他沒有「遇斯光」）
（Huo：他要研究意識的話就很困難的）
你沒有碰到光，你怎麼研究，研究不出來
就像苦修，怎麼苦修都沒辦法
因為這意識本身不會發光
要發光要依靠法性去接觸光
因為上層還有一個法性
（Huo：明白了，就接觸光）
（Huo：不用著急別的物理學家）
（來想這個了）
所以你現在很容易，要碰到光
（Huo：That means still encountering the light ）
（is very important, it's the first priority.）
（Huo：If we don't encounter that light）
（Huo：It's no way for）
（your consciousness to release the light.）
（Nat： yeah）（Huo：that means for the）
（general physicists or quantum physicists）
（Huo：whatever they try to）
（study consciousness）
（Huo：maybe for them is no way to find it.）
（Nat：Yeah, of course. I accept that.）
（Huo：The good news is that we all）
（have encountered the light.）
（Huo：our consciousness can combine with）
（Huo：whatever the light to release.）
（We can release light that light carries）
（Huo：or combined with our consciousness.）
（Huo：Does that answer your question?）
（Huo：You go ahead.）It's on.
（Nat：So, if this light that）
（ we're talking about precedes）
（Nat：the existence of the universe）
（Nat：and it's in theory everywhere）
（we can encounter it everywhere）
（Nat：but does it take a certain）
（state of mind to encounter it?）
（Nat：For instance, without a relaxed enough）
（mind can it be all around us）
（Nat：and we're missing it, we're missing）
（the signs of it, so that's why I keep）
（Nat：I keep drilling into this concept of）
（encountering the light）
（Nat：it's not just what the light is）
（it's what's required of us）
（Nat：to be in a mental state）
（sufficient to encounter the light.）
Ironically, we don't need to be in some
sort of state. Just need to be lucky enough.
（Nat：Lucky?!）Yeah! Because there's no reason.
For example, like Jesus or Buddha.
For example we...
We met Ben-Zun,I didn't do any
meditation when I was a really young kid,
there's nothing about my mental states or my
background. But, just encounter, just like...
There is one lit candle and there is
one candle that hasn't been lit up.
Just touch and it will get..
（Nat：This is karmic.）Yeah...
（Huo：What do you mean that）
（encounter the light everywhere?）
（Huo：What do you mean？）他現在怎麼了？
（他問說到底要有什麼樣的資格）
（Huo：The light is in everywhere.）
（是有什麼資格？為什麼我們能遇斯光）
（我告訴他我們很幸運，就是運氣好）
（Huo：I don't think about that way）
（so far only Ben-Zun）
（Huo：he links with that light）
（and he shares that light）
（Huo：to light up us.）
（So he goes that easy to encounter.）
（Nat：Yeah, that's why I keep asking）
（that question）
（Huo：or..from my experience ）
（Huo：Ｍy understanding, maybe there is no）
（way to encounter the light for all people.）
（Huo：So far from the history only Buddha）
（Jesus, Moses or Ben-Zun）Just randomly.
他碰到你才會產生這個現象
能看到自見其身嘛，他碰到你
（本尊說是不是遇到你）
（才產生這個現象？）
才產生的啊
他以前怎麼沒有看到自己？
用他來做實驗，你說意識
比如說，你現在你看到自己
Can you see yourself again?
做實驗，來做實驗
你看到自己了，穿紅色的
Now, you're wearing the red jacket.
（Nat：Okay.）
看到自己了？
You can see yourself, right now?
那是你的意識，你跟他說
This is your consciousness.
你的意識
你能看到自己，就是光的能量
吸收到光的能量，所以你能…
The reason you can see yourself, because your
consciousness absorb the energy of the light,
so that's why you can see that.
（Nat：Can you say that again？）
The energy of the light.
Because you can see yourself
it must be light. Right？（Nat：Yeah.）
Now, 現在
要把他的意識和光切掉
Now, Ben-Zun is doing some
small experiments. 等一下會給他恢復
later Ben-Zun will recover it.
你再想，看不到自己了
你現在看不到了 Ben-Zun now cut the
flow of consciousness for you.
you cannot do..Just now, you can do anything,
just like we practiced before.
Now, you cannot do that anymore. Just try.
現在什麼都看不到了
Ben-Zun try to do experiment...
（Nat：What am I trying to do now?）
（Huo：Ben-Zun turn off the back light）
（Nat：Oh,I see.）
Ben-Zun is able to
cooperate with the light,
Ben-Zun tries to extract the light
from your consciousness.
Just for temporary, so you can
see now very vague.
Just pure imagination, there's no
你問他們，現在看得到嗎？
看不到 Not substantial again.
等一下會給他們恢復
她還看得到喔，還保留在那邊
現在保留就暫時保留，等一下就消失
慢了一點，我現在針對他
Can you feel the difference right now？
Can you feel the difference？
Never mind, never mind.
現在看不到喔？ Sorry
她還看得到，我針對Nat
Let me explain it again slowly.
我針對Nat
等一下你們兩個
你現在看不到嘛？
Do you feel the
difference right now？
你想看是意識
（Huo：Do you feel that's easy）
（clear as before？）（Nat：No.）
現在沒了喔？（Huo：沒以前清楚）
（他說沒有之前這樣，剩下意識）
消失消失，給你清楚
光出現和你的意識連結
Now, you can see the light pop up again.
And you connect to it that everything
is like clearly and brightly again.
（有了） 有了
這什麼原理呢？
比如說你現在斷掉
What is the principle？
斷掉，沒有說不清楚，就斷掉
OK, again.
做實驗
Now, cut it again.
看到大日在前面
The Great Sun pops up again.
現在你就恢復了
And then you recover everything again.
This is your answer. This is why we discuss
about encountering the light.
Your consciousness, pure consciousness
and pure imagination.
而且更清楚，你也有了
意識本身無實體
必須要相應到光明體的體性，使之「實相實體化」
And then once you have the
function of the light.
You can get this thing substantiated clearly,
so this is the reason why.
會比以前進步了
Now you get really improved
than before whatever.
你跟他講不會再斷掉
（Nina：This is sort of exercise to）
（improve encountering the light）
（Nina：we've already got here）
（before this is start to..？）
Before your meditation, your rituals
or your belief in religion,
everything we use our consciousness.
Our consciousness' function as well.
But if we didn't encounter the light,
it's just like a mere imagination.
But once your consciousness
absorbs the function of the light,
you can see everything clearly bright
and you can feel, you can touch.
（Nina：Go to this encounter is like...hmm）
（Nina：Every time we do this）
（imagination or exercises）
（Nina：to get better and better）
（to encounter the light？）
You've already encountered
the light.
Just now Ben-Zun is just doing some small
experiments for us to experience.
we have consciousness,
but this consciousness
has combined with the function of light.
But we may not realize by ourselves,
so Ben-Zun tries to extract the light.
Cut the function of the light
for you to experience.
他要知道祂光的來源
現在他可以看到大日在前面
我要「切」光的來源出來
Ben-Zun tries to demonstrate
the origin of the light body. 大日就在遠方
像太陽
Can you see the light just like a sun?
蓋過現在的陽光
Really really big now even brightly than
就在眼前 the sun we have seen 一公里
really big. Maybe one kilometer away.
It's a really big sun. (有)
我們視覺看好像一公里
可是好幾光年，妳越走
永遠跟不上
妳分身過去，視覺過去，找不到祂
接近不到祂，一直保持那個距離
Now, we feel like the Great Sun.
光年算的，也很遠很遠
About one kilometer just between us.
Actually. 祂還告訴你，祂會發亮
Ben-Zun asks you to use your energy
body trying to approach it.
You will feel like that you will
never get close to it. Actually
It's like several light years
far away from us.
But our consciousness can
just reduce the distance
and the feeling of the distance.
永遠接觸不到祂，就保持那個距離
You can use your consciousness
to approach the Great Sun.
But you will never get closer,
you just feel still that far.
因為我的意識和祂結合了
所以我說，讓你接觸祂
祂來接觸你
Because Ben-Zun's consciousness
大日靠過來了
has already cooperated with the Great Sun.
祂來這裡變小了，有沒有？
The Great Sun is approaching to you.
It is not that big.
It has become smaller.
And you can see it is in front of you.
我的意識接觸到祂
所以能接近你
和我的意識是相接
（Huo：We encountered the Light.）
（Because the Light cooperate with him,）
（Huo：So that's why we are lucky to get it.）
Lucky is the keyword. It's true.
如果沒有祂
我們所有境界都看不到
Without the Great Sun,
without the light body in this universe,
we can't see anything,
just our imagination.
They are not so
（Huo：Without that light.)
vivid.（Huo：Without the light)
（to cooperate with Ben-Zun.）
（Huo：So we need to go）
（back to do meditation. That's it.）
他也可以也看到大日
那你試試，大日又出現了
大日一出現，你的自見其身
經過大日都不會熱
然後看到一片美麗的天國世界
自見其身出離
出離出去
Now, Ben-Zun is guiding
大日出現
You see the Great Sun appears again.
And then you can see your energy body
going into the sun.
He's inside the sun.
There's a really beautiful realm.
And another beautiful world.
You can see that.
You can see that totally different.
就是所謂天國
This is what they call heaven.
The Buddhists call it nirvana
or something like that.
（Huo：Just walking to the heaven.）
You can arrive there only by your
consciousness with the light function.
你有進去嗎？就很漂亮
This is the only way to get there.
自見其身才能永恆
And this energy body also
it's meaningful because it
indicates eternity, forever.
Because our physical body will
get old, get sick someday
or die someday,
we need to find something.
自見其身是你的第二個生命
This is your second life.
就因為遇到了這個光體
Because you encounter the light.
Just like that.
沒有遇到光體
你不可能自見其身
Without the light, whatever you do,
you still cannot go to there.
因為他來接觸我，第一次他光帶回去
你碰到了，你的法性就接觸了
Because Frank Huo happened to know
Ben-Zun and came to Taiwan.光是從你這緣起
And just did some practices
that like what you guys did.
And then he brought this achievement
所以他帶動你們很快就有
And you happened to know him
and then connected.
他帶動你很快就有，就這樣來源
這和意識沒有關係
但是你要帶動，要用意識表達
The light actually has nothing
to do with your consciousness.
But once you want to guide somebody,
you need to use your consciousness.
The concept is also important
when you accept it,
believe this concept, and you understand
this idea, you will get the light.
Your consciousness can
absorb the light, ok？
So far ok？
（Huo：He told that it's all clear, right？）
（Nat：Yeah.）
所以光就是生命的來源
This is the origin of life.
自見其身的來源，現在變食物
變天食變什麼都有，就是這個
祂來源來自於這裡
那你以前怎麼變不出來
現在可以變出來
甚至你肉身都可以變出來
因為他們碰到祂
這對人類的飲食也很重要
Ben-Zun is trying explain that
戰爭飢餓
For example, you want to
這很重要
You love ramen you can
see a Japanese ramen here.
You can see.
(本尊，我剛剛翻譯你的話)
(她說拉麵，日本的拉麵)
(她就有吃到拉麵)
對，這個就是光的功能
This is the function of the light.
經過妳的意識
經過妳的意識，放光以後成拉麵
It's your consciousness
but with the function of the light.
The ramen is manifested.
然後拉麵出現，你跟她說拉麵變牛排
Become steak.
Can you see the ramen becomes steak？
是說牛排吃膩了 Steak
（Nina：Yes, I can.）
可以變來變去，你跟她說
天地萬物都可以吃得到
You can eat all the food.
All the food in the entire world.
天地萬物
Just use your consciousness.
This light, original 光體
Just with the function of
來源就是這個光體
讓妳吃、喝，什麼都有
The light is the origin.
（Nat：Yeah.）
The momentum for us,
we can make this substantial.
沒有這個光，妳變不出來
妳變不出來，是這個道理
Without the light,
we cannot do this.
所以現在妳要吃什麼都可以了
Just only imagination.
餓了，在飛機上不方便
You already did.
要喝咖啡全部可以，解決人類的饑餓
如果戰爭，可以變很好
Ben-Zun said if there's a war
or some earthquake,
you can have this ramen.
So realistic and you can feel full,
you can feel warm,
and you can taste the ramen.
變一碗更好吃的拉麵，她沒有想到的
Ben-Zun tries to manifest one better ramen.
現在在妳面前了
This one is more delicious than the one.
The previous one.
比妳上次吃的還好吃
麵的來源也是光體
這個光體、大日
The origin, the source of this
ramen is from the light as well.
Not from the farmer..
那妳吃，是用妳的意識
意識產生和光結合，才能吃得到
You feel you are like eating the ramen.
You encountered the light,
so you can have that kind of perception.
I am eating the ramen.
I can feel this ramen is better.
如果意識把妳切掉，妳吃那個拉麵
就沒有什麼味道，試試看
Ben-Zun is trying to do a small experiment.
意識把妳切掉
Try to somehow interfere
you consciousness by the light.
And then you can try the ramen.
The ramen now becomes no flavor.
The soup is no flavor.
沒有味道
No flavor 味道也切掉了
（Nina：Yes.）
（她沒味道了）
沒味道了，味道把妳切掉了
Ben-Zun is temporary to
demonstrate for you to experience.
你說意識可以掌握
意識沒有光不能形成這功能
So if the light didn't cooperate
with you, you will get
現在恢復了
你跟她說現在吃很香了
Now everything becomes perfect.
現在恢復
Your consciousness can
cooperate with the light perfectly.
給她恢復了
So now the soup is delicious again.
就用妳的意識和光這樣結合
就恢復了（有）
This is an experiment Ben-Zun tries
就是這個原理，馬上好
tries to demonstrate for all of us to
understand the difference.
一定要光 So you can feel
the existence of the light.
這樣答案就找到，意識本身沒有光
遇到光才有這種功能
科學家研究光，你怎麼研究
Ben-Zun says for scientists
that try to do experiment
若要研究還要裝電線
or try to do research about this
light, will be really difficult.
任何食物，你想出來都有，這個是意識的功能
Ben-Zun asks you to practice again.
You can eat something else.
Some food else your favorite again.
Does it show up？（Nina：Yes）
What's that？Can I ask？（Nina：Shrimp.）
Shrimp！（蝦）想什麼有什麼
（蝦子）蝦子就有
龍蝦、什麼蝦 Lobster also
你跟她講 lobster，活活的會跳
The lobster is raw. It's like alive.
一念間，用意識
一念間變成生魚片 Use your consciousness.
Now, it becomes sashimi.
Becomes lobster. 瞬間變過來
Becomes lobster salad.
都有，自己選 You can see it
with our Asian traditional mayonnaise.
可以變 With the lobster salad.
（Nina： I see the shell.）
You can see it.（Nina：Yes, open it）
(她說那個殼，可以挖那個蟹肉)
祂自己幫妳挖好
You can use your consciousness.
Your consciousness can help you to
grab the inside of the shrimp.
The lobster
你跟她說出一條烤乳豬
Now, a roast pig.
烤乳豬在她面前，在她前面桌子上
Roast pig.
在妳前面，在妳桌子上
Roast pig .
祂自己切塊，放在妳前面
碟子自己跑出來
for some reason
金色的盤子自己跑出來
There's no one
but you feel the pork
has been sliced on the plate.
那妳吃吃看
On the golden plate.
And then you can try to taste
the roast pork. 乳豬
Did you taste the pork?
祂自己會伸叉子
刀子祂自己會伸出來 Pork
Do you eat the pork？（Nina：Yeah.）
天地萬物，天地所有的都可以
還有飲料都可以
All the food, all the beverage
you can have. 飲料都可以
（飲料也可以）
飲料的話，比如說妳空杯子來
A glass of wine.
高腳杯、紅酒
Can you taste it?
喝下去就是紅酒，最好的紅酒
The best wine ever. Red wine.
最好的紅酒 （Nina：Yes.）都可以
All the food you can eat.
All the beverage…
換句話說
意識可以擁有所有的
只要你有光
In another word, your consciousness
can contain everything in the world,
in the universe as long as you have
encountered the light.
妳可以生活化
You can live with it in your life.
理想化
You can live with it.
而且妳所想要的理想化都可以完成
Everything can be fulfilled.
生活方面
and be achieved by your consciousness.
Once you have the function of the light.
比如說美金十萬在我手上
US dollars, now there's a bunch of US dollars.
美金十萬
有看到我手上有美金嗎？
American US dollars.
（Huo：Hundred thousand dollars.）
In my hand. In Ben-Zun's hand
and you use your vision.
You can see there's a lot of US dollars.
美金十萬，撒過去就都飛了
There's a lot of…
然後一張掉在妳前面
（她拿到一張）
You grab one. 拿到一張
妳給祂看，和真的都一樣You can try
to see that the print. （Nina：Oh yeah.）
真的都一樣
Just like the real one.
(有)
而且散發到天空
Ben-Zun spreads it again.
（柏：We go get it.）撿到就是你的
然後再回到手中來，又回到手中了
Now just go back to Ben-Zun's hand.
成一疊了
Just like rewind.
這可以這樣
無所不到也無所不至
這叫理想，應妳所要的
Omnipotent.
一顆鑽石在妳面前 Now, you can see
one Diamond is in front of you.
Ａ really big Diamond.
亮晶晶的 Shiny.
然後項鏈鑽石
Become necklace.
The diamond becomes necklace.
You are wearing now. 掛在妳脖子
You can see it just like a real one.
和真的都一樣
You just feel like you are wearing
a diamond necklace.（Tesz：Yeah.）
Tesz also has the necklace.
那Nat呢？
一個手錶，勞力士在你手上了
A Rolex watch.
祂還告訴你幾點了，你看
Now you can see the time.
You can you can see the time
by the watch.
可以哦，這也是光的力量
This is also the function of the light.
馬上有，他有嘛，你也有嗎？
我的手，能量從哪裡來？
你跟他講，實驗看看，拿他的…
你有戴手錶嗎？
(有，我有戴錶)
我要拿他的錶了，他失去了意志
他會很自然，你不知道
我要他手錶放在桌子上
他控制，他還是拿來了
好，開始，你跟他說
你先跟他解釋
等一下
Now Ben-Zun is doing an experiment.
把你拉起來，自己放過來
Once Ben-Zun wants to get my watch
and I can't control just now.
Before I haven't translated
and then I can't resist.
而且有禮貌向我行禮，交給我
Ben-Zun will get my watch and
I will be very polite even if
I don't want to do that.
好，開始！
他沒辦法控制，妳跟他說
而且還向我禮貌，這樣跪著
Control your mind.
他站不起來，他定住了，站不起來
他怎麼站都站不起來
這樣起來了，好
是這樣，這個意思
來來來，拿回去了，就這樣
做一個示範，比如說
這個定身法瞬間，他站起來了
做的意思就是，他怎麼坐
都坐不下去了，他就很自然
坐不下去，那個腳坐不下去
定住了，全部定住了
他的頭還會搖，而且直直的
不能搖，妳看，直直不能搖了
就這樣直直的，不能搖了
他這樣暈倒坐在椅子上
你怎麼叫，叫不醒，是這樣
定身法屬於這一類的
沒有叫醒，他不知道
他暈倒，你這個杯子沒有拿起來
他起不來
我這個杯子拿起來，他就醒來了
意識連線，意識
這屬於定身法的範圍，還有舌頭
舌頭也可以拉出來，包括思想
Everything includes your behavior.
舌頭和思想都可以，像舌頭來講
定身法，舌頭把你拉出來咬住
他沒有辦法抵抗
你口罩拿下來，他自己吐出來了
伸不進去，你用力拉不進去
咬住了，他咬住
根據你的意識決定，舌頭進去了
祂可以根據你的意識決定
意識決定說，如果說咬斷
咬斷當然會流血
當然不會咬斷，伸不進去
還有妳定妳的思想mind
妳的思想給妳顛倒
都可以，搞不清楚來
還有呼吸，呼吸也可以定住
Everything. Our behavior,
our mind and our brain,
Ben-Zun can control because...
還有妳想什麼數字
數1234就搞亂了
妳自己數都數不清楚
For example from one to ten,
Ben-Zun can control your
your mind, so you cannot
這也可以定到妳的思想裡面
even count from one to ten. Ben-Zun will
try to demo, you will get messed up.搞亂了
You get really messed up.
都可以，呼吸、思想
都可以定住，定身法的範圍
Ben-Zun says that
we are capable of doing this.
Just now I really try too hard not to do
that because I feel a little shy.
I cannot control, because Ben-Zun
can cooperate with the light
and the consciousness.
思想力量都完全消失了
Everything, our mind, our strength.
Energy lose.
So this is magnificent.
那是另一種意識的層次
意識的層次 This is the other part of
our achievement and experience.
現在妳看我消失了
Can you see Ben-Zun right now disappeared？
Now. Disappeared.
Disappeared right now. Disappeared
消失了，坐在妳那邊，妳坐在這裡了
交換 You're just exchanged.
Now, Ben-Zun is sitting here.
You feel like you are sitting there.
（Nina：Okay.）
這樣可以，妳看
You feel Ben-Zun is sitting here.
And you feel yourself sitting there
and watching us.（Nina：Yeah.）
再換過來，妳可以看到Nat
坐這邊，一樣
Now Nat and Ben-Zun switch. 交換
You can see that Nat is sitting there
and Ben-Zun sits besides you.
換句話，在妳旁邊可以交換
（Nina：Yeah.）
You can do this.
都可以，這個簡單，這樣就很快
牆壁解脫就很簡單了
這個解脫就很簡單，牆壁全部消失了
The wall is disappeared.
妳現在站在山上
You are like sitting on the mountain top.
妳看的是山，遠方的山
In your vision, everything is mountain.
這邊景物都沒有了
These things are kind of
a fade-out or disappeared.
而且看到山，一直看到海
一直山，看到海，妳現在是坐在山頂上
You can see really far and underneath
the mountain, you can see the ocean.
You just feel like you are sitting
你現在介紹她坐在南極了
冰天雪地的南極，現在忽然坐在南極
現在位置全部推掉，變成南極
Now, Antarctica.
（Chloe：You are sitting at the South Pole.）
（Chloe：Iceberg）冰天雪地
（Nat：Lots of Penguins.）
A lots of Penguins.
Do you see penguins？ A lot of Penguins.
You feel like there..
而且妳這裡會冷
Snowy weather, so cold, so freezing.
And a lot of Penguins.
這裡都有感受
（Nina：OK, so I sat in the ice）
Yeah, you sit on the ground of ice.
Really icy ground.
你跟她說冰天雪地
只有她一個人坐那邊
You feel like you are alone sitting
on the icy ground.（Nina：Yeah.）
And then maybe some penguins.
而且會冷，很冷（她有看到企鵝）
（有看到）Penguins
企鵝，還有看到企鵝
企鵝在那裡呱呱呱
Penguins are squawking.
變兩隻企鵝跑到她旁邊來了
Two penguins just approach you.
You can see two penguins.
那這樣道理是意識
意識是指講企鵝叫意識
帶動為什麼祂會來
這個是意識，光後面支持
祂能量在後面支持，就這樣子
解答她的答案 Now Ben-Zun is
trying to explain the principle.
These penguins and icy ground is
from your consciousness. 那是意識
But when we try to ask the
penguins to come here.
What makes this possible?
What makes this realistic?
It's the momentum of the light.
The function of the light,
so your consciousness with
a function of the light.
These things become possible.
You feel like that you are actually there.
兩隻企鵝在她旁邊了
You can see two penguins, right？
企鵝走到她旁邊，妳給祂摸，都企鵝
Just beside you.
Try to touch the penguins.
A little bit frozen？Its hair is frozen.
先在那邊摸，這邊就摸得到
（Nina：Yeah.）
祂現在跑到這邊了
也可以跑來這裡讓妳摸 (她正在摸)
Did you touch the penguins？
（Nina：Yeah, slippery.）
（她說滑滑的）滑滑的
Because it's icy cold.
在那邊摸，跑來這裡也可以
瞬間，妳換個北極，北極熊
Now go to the North Pole.
瞬間一樣冰天雪地
You can see the polar bear.
Polar bear.（Nina：OK.）
Now you are in different..
Still in the icy ground, and
there's a really big polar bear
一隻很大的北極熊來了
comes to you？妳抓祂的皮厚厚的
You try to grab its skin
and touch its...（Nina：OK.）
北極熊，妳給祂抓，厚厚的
This is different from the penguins.
（Nina：Yeah）（有）
你問他要不要去洗手間？
他要去洗手間 （麻煩帶他去洗手間）
他剛就要去洗手間了
(照見那個往生者)
往生者你有照見過
(最近又有一些要照見的)
上次你在威斯汀，不是有照見嗎？
(對，那是我們家的)
你現在要照見和上次的不一樣
(不一樣的) 要不一樣
一樣的已經上去了 (對)
好，你要照見誰？
(就是很古老的祖先)
你認識嗎？ (不認識)
祂會把你全部照出來，可是要你認識
比較有意思，祂能照到你認識的
不認識不用說了
祂就一樣可以照見到
祂照見的廣度很廣
先照見你認識的 (好)
認識的準，那邊就準
祂也順便會，漩渦光給你找出來 (好)
你想在心中幾個
講幾個就好 (五個)
是哪裡人？ (大陸那邊的)
大陸，你去過他家嗎？ (去過)
他家出現，就全部在這裡集合
他家有沒有出現？ (有)
你這種程度可以看到他家
他家出現，鄰居左右都出來
你跟他們解釋 Ben-Zun is trying to illuminate
Frank's dead family members.
五個都出來了 Dead family members.
這五個
Ben-Zun is trying to use the Spiral Light
to illuminate（有）清楚嗎？
（清楚） family members.
你知道他的名字嗎？（知道）
五個名字打出來，金字！很漂亮的字
Now Frank can see his dead family members
and see their names.沒有錯？（對）名字也對
人也對，還帶微笑
很高興，還向我們禮敬
你看（有）
Ben-Zun is trying to lead them
to the realm of the light because
Frank asks Ben-Zun to do that
and then they go to the heaven.
把祂們送到大日去，這樣就照見
親眼看到為主 (有) 你說沒關係
看什麼，盡量講，來
請求本尊給他們加圓光
Now, Frank is asking Ben-Zun to give you guys
the Halo, the Circle Light.
Once you guys obtain this Circle Light,
you can go to the realm of the Dharma or
realm of the divinity or heaven whatever
you call. You can be there forever
and never get reincarnation.
You can stabilize your Dharma body,
your energy body once you have this Halo.
So that's why when you see
the paintings for the Buddha's paintings
or some Christian paintings,
they all have this Head Light.
This Halo or the Circle one, and
then Ben-Zun tries to illuminate
to give you guys this one. So you can
bring this back.
Once you have this one, maybe your friends,
your family members
they can also encounter
this Light from you.
Frank doctor Huo is now asking Ben-Zun
to give you guys this one. （Nina：Yeah.）
他們怎麼樣？（他們說要圓光）
他們沒有要圓光？(要)
(然後我解釋圓光的作用)
(因為霍醫師有跟他們解釋過圓光)
圓光很重要
Ben-Zun says that the Halo is really
important. If you guys want,
Ben-Zun will try to help you guys
to have it. 圓光代表你永恆了
你的法身圓滿了 Once you have this Halo Light
which means your energy body
or we can say your spiritual body
is really completed, full established
and can access all the functions.
So you must have this light first.
圓光要修成圓滿的人，才能有圓光
要遇到光體才有圓光
圓光是光體給你照，給你安的
不是我，你要講清楚
Ben-Zun is so humble. Ben-Zun says that
he is not the one gives you the Halo,
the Circle Light. It's the light body.
Because Ben-Zun can cooperate with
the light bodies, so Ben-Zun can ask the
light bodies to give you the Circle Light
to give you the Halo.
因為我能相應到祂
所以根據我的意識
祂來給你安，祂的功能，功能是祂
Ben-Zun's consciousness can
correspond with the light so once
Ben-Zun wants to give you this light.
The light bodies can help Ben-Zun,
can cooperate with Ben-Zun
to give you guys having this Halo.
好，開始給他們安
(好) 天冠光知道嗎？天冠光
(你有介紹過天冠光嗎？)
天冠光 (The Crown Light.)
（Huo：the Crown Light）
天冠光出現，具體的，立體的
黃金色的，矗立在空中
This is what we called the Crown Light.
This is another 現在空中
Light body. 這個是重點
It's the Crown Light. It's like a Crown.
The Crown Light.
而且祂像建築物一樣金剛的
So magnificent, and it's just
like a building. 比教堂還壯觀
Bigger than the church.
有看到喔？
It's the arch one.
就這個在空中
Now, you can see.
而且這個不是光
這個是一個變成具體的、立體的建築物
Now, it becomes solid, substantial.
矗立在空中很穩定
You can see it just in the sky. Very stable.
然後中央大日 In the middle, the Great sun
manifested in the middle.
This is the Great Sun.
What it looks like. 位在中間
Can you see？ The Crown Light
and in the middle.
There is the Great Sun in the middle
of the Crown Light.
大日的前面，漩渦光開始轉，三個連續
The Spiral Light is at the front.
You can see
three light bodies at once.
The Spiral Light is
in front of the Great Sun
and the Crown Light covers the Great Sun.
So you can see three light bodies at once.
漩渦光前面，中央那裡是照明鏡
If you try to look into the center
of the Spiral Light, we call it
the Illuminating Mirror.
現在大日走到最前面
The Great Sun is moving forward to here.
有看到大日嘛？
You can see the Great Sun just here.
而且大日好像一面鏡子一樣
看到你們自己，自己可以看到
The Great Sun just becomes like a mirror.
You can see yourself.
Just like reflecting yourself.
You can see yourself in the
Nat 有看到嗎？ Just like this. It's similar like
a mirror. Can you see yourself？
Like a reflection in the Great Sun.
在裡面，有嗎？（有看到）
這樣你們看後面有圓光了
Now, you can see yourself in the Great Sun.
You've got the Halo, the Circle Light.
你自己從後面看，有圓光了
You can see that you got
the Halo Light, right？
(他說那個大日裡面的，有圓光了)
他看到大日的話，在裡面有他的相
他自己看到後面就有圓光了
Now, once you see yourself in the Great Sun
with the Halo Light, at the same
time you can feel yourself...
you have the Halo Light
on your physical body.
只要看到大日裡面有祂，他就有了
At the same time.
Almost simultaneously.
霍醫師，你有嗎？(有)
圓光，這樣就有圓光
Do you see that？
Just feel like you have the...
平常回家以後，隨時都可以看到
From now on, every time
you can see your Halo.
This is like to make your
spiritual body or energy body,
what we call it to be stable.
Once you have this, which means
access the full function.
Full function of your inner wisdom.
圓光代表法身圓滿
永恆的意思  Complete.
看要再問什麼？
講些什麼？ (好)
Nat 他上面又多了兩瓶礦泉水
而且礦泉水都滿了
Can you see this bottle of water?
他多兩瓶礦泉水出來
You can see there is
two more bottles of water.
新的水，實相的
請他拿起來，像剛剛那樣轉開蓋子
轉和真的都一樣Can you try to use your
physical hand to touch that bottle of water?
你試試看，拿起來看看
Try to use.
You must see very clear and try.
拿起來
轉開來喝 You can try to open up
the lid and then drink.
一樣喔？ 真的一樣
可以和真的一樣 (有)
比如說我現在，只有我有這杯茶
你先看，你們現在也是有這一杯了
OK，和我一樣
Now, Ben-Zun is showing you
there is a cup…在你桌上了
Ben-Zun's cup of tea..
Now, you can see that cup.
另外一杯和這個一樣在你桌上
霍醫師，你一樣看 identical cup
你有一杯，在你那裡
在這裡 on this table
（本尊，他有耶，Nat有）
我的這一杯分出去，你們都有
Can you see？
你沒問題啦
one identical cup
然後有沒有實體？
就摸摸看有沒有熱
Can you touch it and feel
the temperature if it's hot？
然後我要喝，不是只有我喝
指的是一杯給我，你們都有了
所以，你現在把祂喝下去一樣有
祂移到你面前，祂自己讓你嘴巴喝
像我現在喝茶
你也可以喝到這個茶味
Even if you're wearing a mask,
you can still taste the tea.就這個茶
You can feel the temperature.
可以喝 Can you do that？
那有重量嗎？
Do you feel its weight？
You can feel its weight.
喝下去就是茶味
（本尊她說，她看得到你那個杯子）
（然後喝得到）
（也有茶）so you can taste the tea
她現在可以看得到這裡
我現在分一杯在她面前
Now there's one more identical cup
with tea inside. That tea cup now.
Identical cup with one Ben-Zun's holding.
Now you can also use
your consciousness and drink it.
You feel the hardness of the cup and
you can feel inside of the tea is
a little bit warm, a little bit bitter,
like the traditional Chinese Oolong tea.
（他們都有，茶味都有味道）
茶味都有（茶的味道都有）
看有沒有重量？手拿出來
有沒有重量 use your physical hand
You use your consciousness
to put that cup on your palm.
你這種程度
有重量，還有熱度
Your consciousness can feel the
weight on your palm, can you？
（他們三個都有）左手摸看看，熱度？
You still use
the other hand to touch
you can feel the tea cup
熱熱的，看有沒有溫度
also a little bit hot.
You can take it.
（Nat：Yeah.）
（他們都有）溫度都有（對）
The temperature a little bit hot,
it's a cup of warm tea.
Ｓo that you can feel its warmth.
針對你表達
Even if you're wearing a mask,
you can still drink it.
（他們都戴口罩也喝得到）
戴口罩不影響，因為祂超越物質
Even if you're wearing the mask
There is no limit. It's okay,
because it transcends
this matter,
and transcends the substance.
你們剛才在漢神喝咖啡嗎？
漢神的周圍出來了
Now you can see…this morning
You guys had the breakfast
in the buffet restaurant.
all the buffet restaurant now
appeared just around you.
You can see the coffee machine,
the drinking machine there
看到他坐在那裡 You can see
one more of yourself sitting there.
Like…the exact scenery
in the morning 在喝這杯茶
and drinking the coffee or tea
in the morning 就這杯
這個杯子擠進去了
This cup now fills in the scenery,
so you can see yourself in the
buffet restaurant, and also
you can see Ben-Zun's cup also in there.
一樣在那裡喝，這裡有味道
You can see yourself drinking that cup of tea
but you can still feel the same feeling
Feel the tea so you can feel that tea.
You can taste the tea.
The taste of the tea is the same.
都有喔？（對，三個都有）
無距離限制
無遠近，there's no distance
甚至於這杯茶擺在你家的客廳
Now you can see this cup showing up in
your living room, maybe in New York,Ｉguess.
You're in the living room,
in your house in New York.
The cup is exactly the same,
identical one.
那杯茶也擺在你家裡的桌子上（有）
on the coffee table in your living room
看到你坐在那邊喝，家庭生活這樣
這裡一樣有味道
Now, you can see yourself
sitting on the sofa and you're drinking
Just like you're drinking that tea in the
living room, but you can feel the tea.
You can taste the tea here, so you
share the same feeling.
（他們都有）所以這杯茶能聞得到
在那邊喝，這裡相應得到
自見其身要透過「意識流」
意識流把它解讀為「生命線」
你的法性意識流露出來
然後你在這裡
意識可以串通法性，意識流形成對看
Ben-Zun is now giving some simple explanations.
The reason why you can feel the tea,
taste the tea, is because of
our stream of our consciousness
or we can say flow of consciousness.
Our consciousness becomes like a flow.
Like water flow, you connect to it,
or Ben-Zun uses the other word.
He calls it lifeline. Our line just like a
line of connection to your life.
This is your…you say energy body.
This one is your physical body,
but you share the consciousness
via this line.
We call this a flow of consciousness.
比如說他能站在虛空了嘛
他的自見其身
意識流
然後你的視覺在那裡看到你
You have the other vision in that body,
and you can use that vision
to look at you sitting here right now.
Just like mutual.
You can see the other self
and see you here.
（Nat：as reciprocal）
Yeah, reciprocal
（他說他互相…）each other
each other
（本尊，他們可以看到）
就each other
彼此看得到（對）
彼此看得到這一條線叫意識流
This is the line called the flow or stream
of consciousness. This is the consciousness.
How can we connect from our
physical consciousness to the energy body.
This is why Ben-Zun explains these.
比如說剛才他在漢神喝那一杯茶
就是靠這個意識流傳遞
再遠無所不到
That's why when Ben-Zun just demonstrated
this cup of tea.
There is no space, no time because of
this kind of flow of the consciousness.
This can transcend space.
This can transcend time.
Now, this is a basic small demonstration
that Ben-Zun is trying to show you
the importance of
this flow of consciousness.
所以同時，現在自見其身
還在空中
You're still in the sky.
Now, You're still standing in the sky.
你手一樣拿著這杯茶
You can see that you're holding this cup
and trying to drink it.
（都有嗎？）Can you see yourself？
（他們三個都有）
這個意識流就是構成
宗教永生的條件
連續線！生命的延續線
Ben-Zun now explains that this flow of
consciousness is the requirement for
people who search for religion
for life to get eternal.
This is the continuum of our life.
If we can discover this flow of
consciousness, we will achieve
the goal for people that pursue in religion,
just get the eternal life.
把意識流建立起來
無所不在
If you can establish
this flow of consciousness,
you can feel omnipresence,
that you can be everywhere.
（Nat：omnipresence）
omnipresence.
這個牆壁裡面，這個牆壁
你可以把它解脫掉
變成玻璃、琉璃世界
Now, the wall
the material is like tiles.
Now you can replace it like a glass wall.
It becomes glass. （Nat：OK）
It's transparent.
他的自見其身在裡面
You can see your energy body
Your the other self inside the wall.
琉璃世界，牆壁推掉了
沒有牆壁了
This wall with the tiles has
been replaced, now you can see just
a bunch of glass
變成都琉璃
變成琉璃世界jade, crystal
and you can see you 他們都有？（有）
你在裡面 inside the wall
個人站在裡面都可以
（他們都可以）都可以
這樣就很好帶動
這個意識流
用生活化，你的視覺進入桌底下
看這個桌角，桌底下那個角
繞一圈
一個珠珠，小珠珠，光亮的珠珠
帶動你的意識看
Now, Ben-Zun is showing and demonstrating
the other part to
practice our flow of consciousness.
這張桌子的四周
We got this table, and you can use
your flow of consciousness.
Just go under this table
一個小光點 you can see
you can see there, just like a vision.
You can just go through
underneath of this table.
Going there... 有看到嗎？
Like a small light ball
in your consciousness.
（Huo：Like a spotlight）
跟著祂走，小珠珠
Guide your vision.
You have the other vision now.小光點
It's like scanning the bottom
of the table.
任何細微
Can you see it？（他們都有）
You can see your vision.
If you can see your vision in the sky,
in the wall,under table should be
the same.
（Huo：Let it come to become）
（the one spotlight, follow the spot light.）
Like what Frank said,
you can see a really tiny spotlight
or the tiny sparkle and moving around
underneath this table.
這個視覺可以進入你體內
這個視覺，從喉嚨進入你體內
看你的內臟
You can see this small light
going to inside your body.
You can see your organ.現在停在喉嚨，看下去
Now in your throat. 然後走下去
You can see there is a little bit more
eyes in your throat.看到脊椎骨
In your consciousness.
You can see your spine 肝臟、肺部、心臟
liver.. inside your organ.
你的視覺在裡面了
Can you do that？（Nat：Yup）
祂無所不到
This is called everywhere.
到你的腳都可以
You can see everything at once, or you
can just like scanning one by one
one organ by one organ...
祂回到你的眉心這裡and then
go back to your...between eyebrows.
稍微透明的光珠Just a little bit
transparent like an orb.
A little bit transparent,
but now it's stopping between your eyebrows.
Can you see that？
（Yes）他們都有
這個光珠你再發出去，把這個
牆壁再推掉
You use this orb, like
a projector to project.
Now, this wall disappears.
看到你們熟悉的紐約市
紐約市（go to the New York City）
現在是晚上嘛？
Ben-Zun says 晚上嗎？
now it's night time.
In New York now it's at night time.
You can see the city view of
entire New York City.現在是晚上
你能把晚上紐約市變白天
你看，這樣子你可以
Ben-Zun said that you guys
are capable of changing to day time.
Now it's night time. You can see
the city view is night time？
Or day time.
是這個意思
現在就很亮了（他們變過去了）
用這樣變
（可以） 他有嗎？
（Nat：better）
Now is better（他說有了，他說更清楚）
（霍醫師，有嗎？）
一定要先有意識流
The reason we can do this
we must understand the function
of the flow of consciousness,
and then we start to be able to change
from day time to night time,
and also this is called liberation.
這個意識流，首先
你來這裡先帶這個，顯發這個意識流
是解決生命的奧妙
這個意識流
可以看世界任何一個地方，無所不到
你隨便想到你自己的城市都可以出現
我是比如說紐約
甚至任何地方
你自己想自己做
都可以照出來給你看，就在那邊
透明！馬上世界變透明
Ben-Zun tries to explain if you master
this, the flow of consciousness,
you will find the mystery of life
or the answer of life.
Because everything is contained
in this small...spot（Nat：Yeah. ）
You're able to change it.
When you go back to New York City,
you can change everything via your
consciousness. You know how to control it.
You will find the answer of
the unsolved problem of our life.
All of them are inside in this
flow of consciousness.
當你要回家以後
要看的時候，你先把這個舉上來
在眉心上有一個白圓圓的小珠珠
At the beginning…go back to your country
or go back to your house, go home,
and if you try to practice this part
just to imagine your
（這個嘛？）對，這個
just like this.
This is Ben-Zun in his thirties.
你自己現在也可以弄出來
Just like this. The transparent light.
and before you try to practice
all of these.
You can see yourself.
There is a transparent orb
between your eyebrows and then
starts to function
to go everywhere.
試著用這顆發出去，你自己發，看到紐約
First, you think that there is a
transparent orb here.
This is your consciousness. Go to New York
自己發出去，有沒有看到？ Can you see？
發出去，祂自己可以變化
（Nat ：Light ball）（Nina：Yup.）
Like a small light ball, but this
light ball contains your consciousness.
and then, this light ball can
go to New York City right now.
So you can see the New York City
is at night time.
You can browse around the city,
（Nina：Yeah, in my neighborhood.）
the neighbors.
（城市的鄰居都看得到）
（她說她剛發出去）
祂自己會表達出來
（對）自己會表達出來
鄰居詳細都可以看得清楚
The function will go automatically.
The more you practice,
the more you will experience.
如果更廣大的話，看得更廣大
前面要那個漩渦光
那張拿起來，漩渦光
If you want to see something
in a large scale, 漩渦光現就在你們面前
you need to have this Spiral Light,
just like a vortex 漩渦光在更廣大
This is Spiral Light. 現在你意識流出去
祂這個在前面走
Can you see this Spiral Light first？
這個帶你入，層面都非常廣
and you use the light ball
of your consciousness
Go to everywhere.
You can see the Spiral Light.祂能更廣大
在虛空，祂能照到整個地球
First, we can see the Spiral Light now.
It's enlarging. It's very big.
Like the entire sky you can
你的意識流可以看到
整個在虛空
see the Spiral Light. Can you？
更高更遠
really big right now. Very big！
然後可以找到紐約
局部也可以找到紐約
（是這個漩渦光找到紐約）是漩渦光
漩渦光出去的話
已經看到地球了，在虛空
This Spiral Light is really big
然後你的意識流發出去
even bigger than the earth.
你想看哪裡都可以看到 It's very big.
If you want to find New York,
it goes to find New York right away.
Your consciousness can go to New York,
and you can see really large scale
with this Spiral Light.
這個時候所看到的
就是你自見其身看的
（Nat：This vortex）
Because the main function
of this Spiral Light,
it can go through different universes.
But, actually we say different time and space.
Also dimensions.
The function for the Spiral Light
you can go to any space and time.
And now in our point of view,
we need to have our consciousness
to cooperate with this Spiral Light,
so we can be everywhere,
every space and time.
如果這顆出現的話
可以看整體的
（Huo：Like, you got the actual）
（whole universe.）（Nat：Yeah.）
怎麼樣，這個可以，好
這顆可以，她可以看到紐約
她說鄰居都可以（對）
You can see the neighbors
in your New York house.
也可以看到…
（Nat：Unfortunately）
（本尊請繼續） occasional 偶然的
（不是，他是說真糟糕竟然看到鄰居）
（他不是很想看鄰居的樣子）
都可以看到
這個時候是你的自見其身看的
It's your energy body.
The function of your energy body.
自見其身在上面看的
然後意識流傳遞給你看
Your energy body goes there first
and…how can I say,the perception.
It's like to transmit through
the flow of consciousness.
所以你和
和他的自見其身同步進行
You can feel your physical body,
and your energy body like simultaneously.
Go parallel.
你肉身不能到的，自見其身可以到
Somewhere your physical body can't arrive,
but your energy body can go.
比如說，你現在不能摸到
紐約港的勝利女神
那你的自見其身
站在勝利女神旁邊，摸祂那一根火把
You can see the Statue of Liberty.
Can you see the Statue of Liberty？
自見其身站在女神旁
Our physical body will never get to
touch the top of the Statue, right？
他這裡有感覺
Your energy body now
is standing beside the Statue.
Standing in the sky, your energy body
touches the statue.
and you have the feeling.
touch her torch or touch her tiara？
（Nat：the crown）
（我說他們的王冠，火把）王冠都有
下面還有一個台
There's a foundation that you can...
下面還有一個廣場
There is a square.
可以站的地方
Square for tourists.
You can see everything clearly.
任何地方
包括她巴西的那個耶穌
巴西耶穌
You can go to...you can go back to
your hometown just like Rio.
You can see a big Statue of Jesus.
伸手那個都可以看得清楚
不要說勝利女神
Is that in Rio？（Nat：yeah）
（他也有看到）這個時候
你發現你的自見其身就在那邊
Now you can see your energy body,
the other yourself standing in the sky
besides the statue in Rio.
（Nina：In Rio？）（Nat：The Cristo）
Also you can see the city,
the mountain, everything.
（我順便帶動說，她連那座山）
（那個雕像下面的山）
有時候，我沒有講到
祂自己會出來（都有看到）
You can see the mountain.
（Nina：Yes.）
一即一切，都一樣
無限都有，等於無限
一即一切
各種城市，各種地方都一樣
無所不到，就是你這一顆
包括進入永恆之路
當我們人死亡的時候
你的自見其身站在你旁邊
你們還對看
對看，等到你斷了以後
你的氣就斷了
這個就帶著你今生的記憶往生
永恆之路（好，我試著翻譯）
This is very important for human
when we are about to die.
Really old and really sick
about to die
and you can use
your flow of consciousness.
Maybe your physical body is really sick,
but your consciousness can
go to your energy body.
and then, this flow of consciousness contains
all the memories of your life.
and you will feel like
"OK,I'm in a new body right now."
So that's why you have the other new life.
所以自見其身
就是他的第二生命
This is your second life and
this life is eternal.
我們肉身還在的時候
祂和我們合為一體
合一，就過著人間的生活
非常完美的
Now we are still healthy enough,
we can still practice our energy body
and we can unify with it.
After our physical body gets really bad,
sick, and old,
we can go to the other...
just like move to new house.
Now our consciousness is in our physical body.
It's like a current house.
We are able to shift our consciousness
to new energy body
to get a new life.（Chloe：reborn）
Yeah, you got reborn.
這個意識流
簡單的說就是無所不到，包括海底
現在海底馬上出現
Ben-Zun is now trying to...
海底就是海底
You can use your flow of consciousness
to go to look 你的意識流發出去
the bottom of the ocean. You can see
進入海底了，你在這裡看得到
bottom of ocean, you can feel
這個時候，意識流涵蓋你的自見其身
the pressure
the water pressure and you can see
the bottom of the ocean.
然後看到潛水艇
There's one submarine just coming here.
You can see the submarine.
意識流馬上可以變成自見其身，摸潛水艇
You can see yourself
your energy body beside the submarine.
You can touch the surface
of the submarine.（都有，都有）
甚至找潛水艇那個螺旋槳
（ok）可以把它停止，把它滅除
你自見其身這時候看到，停止
潛水艇壞了，You can see the turbine
You can use your...就這個
無所不到的意思
and you won't get hurt.
You can feel everything. （都有）
You can use your consciousness
（有船員、機器）
to go into the submarine.
（結構，都看得一清二楚）
You can see a lot of soldiers inside.
They are... 在那裡工作
在那裡 mechanics…
They are doing some work inside the submarine.
Feel like you're in the submarine.
潛水漸漸浮起來了
Now it's 看到水面了
going to the surface of the water.
能讓你站在水面上，看到潛水艇
那裡很不好站
看到你們的自見其身在向你揮手
You can feel that he is just
standing on top of the submarine,
but it's very difficult to stand.
You can feel it's also slippery,
but you can feel you're
standing on a submarine
trying to wave to someone
or maybe wave to us.
Can you feel that it's still
difficult to stand？
Because it's very wet.
所以自見其身浮在水面了（對）
你看到自見其身，看到他們自己
然後回到你身體來，祂不用那一顆珠
回到你身體來，祂背向著你
進去你裡面
Now you see your energy body
standing on the submarine.
Ben-Zun tries to guide your energy body
to go back to your physical body,
but we change different form,
not that light orb.
You can see your energy body
coming back to you,
going to in front of you.
and then, become like face the same direction.
In the beginning, you're face-to-face.
You see when he approaches to you,
he will turn back and go back to unify.
Going into your body.
Now you can feel your energy body
unified with your physical body.
自見其身出去要化成這個
就是你的意識流
剛才這顆，平常就在你裡面
你把祂切出來，在你這裡都看得清楚
你就看這裡有一顆圓圓的
透明，半透明的（好）
沒有全透明，半透明（都有OK）
現在就看到了
你現在告訴他
現在先出來這裡
Now you can see that there is one transparent.
Let's practice that again.
You can see the
transparent orb there.
有看得到才可以
Can you see it right now？
Nat、霍醫師有看到嗎？（有）
好，這顆發出去了，出去了
到黑暗的地方，天空很高
一直往空中
黑暗的到外面是滿天星星的
This orb is going to
go to really high 非常高
really high and get really dark.
一樣有月亮You can see the moon.
伯利恆，不是有五博士
看到東方之星
Like the story before Jesus was born.
There were doctors. They saw the light,
the star. 五個博士騎著馬
騎著馬在晚上都看得到
Now you're just like to repeat
鏡頭出來，照他們以前的
repeat the scenery
照見他們以前的狀況
in the story of the bible.
Now you can just repeat again,
and you can experience that yourself.
So once you can do this flow of conscious,
you can master this one.
You can see that
there's a transparent orb here,
and then I just follow the story
before Jesus was born.
Someone said that
there's a star or something.
There are some doctors saw
the star they knew in east.
（Nat：Yeah, Star in east.）
You can repeat 現在鏡頭有沒有看到
五博士騎著馬在黑暗中？
看到那顆星 Now you can see five doctors,
they are like riding horses.
Like the story 他們有看到嗎？
（Nat：In the dessert.）
In the dessert.
（他說在沙漠裡面）
就是當時的情形，這個光體
我們這個光體，把它照出以前那個樣子
看到東方之星
You can move everything,
the story and the plot.
The scenario in front of you.
You can feel you're a part of it.
（都有他們都覺得）
你們這一顆發出去，變成星星
一直找到那個東方之星
和祂結合，很高很高
祂在那裡
在東方之星那繞圈子（OK）
You can see this orb going to
the eastern star
Like the one
recorded in the story and
You can see the
star orbiting and you can feel it.
So now everything and your vision
is from your transparent orb.
他有嗎？（OK？）現在還在繞
現在繞著東方之星，還在繞
就是指這一顆
（Nat：The orb is connecting to the star.）
那個高度，高空到五博士那邊都看得到
If you want to connect,
You will connect to the star
光幫你照出來
同時照到印度那個夜睹明星
 Go to India.
In the Buddhist sutra...
the Buddha saw a really bright star.
You can see that star and go
to ancient India.
看到釋迦佛
在那個菩提樹下看到的
表達出來，祂照出來這個就是
You can see the Buddha meditating
beside the tree.他看到的就是這顆
meditating at a tree. You can see？
and then you can notice
（Huo：This is not from meditaion,it's true）
（Huo：What is happening now.）
（Nat：Yeah.）
有看到嗎？
釋迦佛打坐打到很瘦了，那時候很瘦
That one is Buddha, who looks very thin.
He looks so weak because he is meditating.
（Nat：ascetic） 那一顆在那裡繞完以後
祂回來了 Also you can see
you like you're that star回到你的眉心
notified by the Buddha and oh
回到他的眉心，停在這裡
you can come back to yourself
and then stop here, go back to yourself.
你現在看到這裡半透明
Now it's like semi-transparent.
可以看到
這個廣度要靠那個漩渦光
The reason why we can go to
different space and time
because this is just beyond your knowledge
and your consciousness.
So we need to borrow the function
of the Spiral Light.
Do you remember that Ben-Zun has
just introduced the Spiral Light,
and I said that this Spiral Light can
go to different universes
different space and time. So now
Ben-Zun is practicing with this Spiral Light,
and then use your consciousness
to go to different time even in Jesus
time or Buddha time.
Different era.
And also different universes.
你這一顆珠跟著漩渦光移動
祂可以照出八大行星
或者黑洞、白洞
都可以照出來
If you're able to
cooperate with your consciousness,
and with the Spiral Light.
這顆一定要在前面
You can go to outer space to see the planets,
the black hole and the white hole.
All the outer space you can see.
（Nat：What is the Genesis of ）
（the Spiral Light？）
（Nat：Are we the Genesis）
（of the Spiral Light？）
（Nat：Do we create the Spiral Light？）
No, it's just there for...
（Huo：It's fundamental）
（他問說：是我們創造了漩渦光？）
不是，這不是識變
（他問說是漩渦光，是我們把祂給）
（創造出來或者是誰創造出來的？）
意識流，比如說我們的意識
要表達我們要看哪裡
這個光體就可以，因為祂
宇宙時空一切現象，祂都知道
祂就幫你照出來，我們意識能
天人合一以後，你就能穿梭祂們
祂就告訴你，懂不懂？所以這不是識變
不是我們想像創造的，不是
This is not from someone
who created or imagine that.
This is like the original light source
so that's why Jesus encountered the light.
The Buddha encountered the light.
They can understand the wisdom of all universe
in different space and time.
So now
This Spiral Light is traveling through
all the different universes.
If our consciousness flow can touch and
encounter this light,
we can cooperate, we can how can I say..
access this Spiral Light's function.
And we are able to browse
different space and time.（Nat:That's portal）
Oh yes, It's like a portal,
so we call it teleportation.
（我跟他講說就像瞬間移動一樣）
（他說就像一個，他說PORTAL的意思）
（其實就是傳送點）
（但是漩渦光）
（有了漩渦光才有辦法傳送到）
一定要漩渦光，沒有光沒有辦法
光穿梭祂都知道
OK, you must have this light.
那你接通祂了就知道
這個眉心放光才可以
暫時放眉心放光讓
你們上去（OK）
好，我翻譯這一段
你說你現在只是天人合一的光
還沒有眉心放光
Now because Ben-Zun is…
Ben-Zun's light can radiate from
between his eyebrows
just like the picture
just like this one. And once you
achieve this achievement,
you're able to connect to the
different light bodies. But, now
Ben-Zun just like somehow borrowed
the Spiral Light for you to experience,
so you can unify your consciousness
and your physical body.
Your consciousness can go with
the function of the Spiral Light.
Once you have light radiation
from between the eyebrows,
you will be able to cooperate
with all the light bodies in the universe.
Ben-Zun is trying to explain to you.
當你深入接觸到光體的時候
相應到的時候，祂就停在你這裡
這樣稱作眉心放光
這不是體內出來的，這是光體來的
所以你們的目標就是眉心放光
The ultimate goal is to be like this.
所有佛教徒修道人的目標就是眉心放光
All the philosophers and all of people
who search for religions
are for this ultimate goal.
This is a final, final goal.
因為釋迦佛說有了眉心放光
他宣布宇宙人生的實相就成立了
That's why when Buddha had this light,
he understood the true meaning
or true form of life and the universe.
That's why Buddha said that he understand…
宇宙人生的實相
實相 the true form of the universe
and the life
有人生，有宇宙
We have this life and
we have the other life,
which is encounter with the entire universe.
That's why Buddha had the epiphany, right？
而且這個光體能照到過去
This light can go...we can see the past.
So just like..
比如說你的過去
他小孩子的時候，念大學的時候的樣子
二十歲的樣子，照他的過去
trying to demonstrate.
You can see yourself during the college time.
You were a student,
but you can see right now in the college.
就這個樣子，看是不是這個樣子？
Can you see that you're a college student？
You can see yourself in the
college just like this.
祂可以照到你的過去
This light can illuminate your past.
星光、月亮也是以前
過去的星光和現在一樣
祂能找出來哪一個
This light has wisdom that can find
the past, present and future.
That's why Ben-Zun says
that it goes everywhere.
有一天回去以後
你們有一天在看境界的時候
看到大日的時候，看到一直看
祂會繞到停在你這裡了
那你就眉心放光，就這麼簡單
This one is really important.
After you go back to your country
or go back to your home,
you just…when you practice it,
you can see a really great sun.
It's like the sun in our galaxy,
but it's different. This is the sun in
how can I say, spiritual universe,
and then when you practice more
you will someday or sometime feel the sun
coming to approach you,
and stops in between your eyebrows,
and then you will get this achievement.
這個就是大日！
We call it the Great Sun.
Also this is the name of our association.
Once you have the function,
you're able to change,
to liberate.（Nat:The Spiral Light...）
There are several light bodies and
the Great Sun just like..
The Great Sun just like a big sun
and circle light,
which can illuminate and manifest everything.
But, the Spiral Light's function is to help
you to go through different universes.
There are so many light bodies
that we haven't studied.
They have different functions
once we encounter the light.
We will start to understand the function
of the light by ourselves.
That's why the Buddha said that
we have the wisdom hidden inside
（Nat：yeah） our mind.
So we need to find it.
They call it wisdom, not knowledge.
It's wisdom.
在流露境界的時候
有時候是你的想像
你的意識想像
有時候超越你的想像
那個就是祂，你所不知道的
和你所知道的，祂都可以呈現
Sometimes we practice this.
Most of them
or some of them,
we may use our imagination.
I can say that I imagine it is like this,
but some of them will transcend
our imagination. It will go
Like you said that you can
see the neighbors. Maybe you
didn't think of your neighbors.
It just popped up.
Just showed up. Some of them is the
wisdom from the light.
The light can just like capture everything,
can contain everything inside.
But sometimes we haven't noticed.
Once we can understand this
or cooperate with the light.
we are able to do that to travel around.
你眉心放光以後，這個漩渦光
可以帶著你的視覺
八大行星以外，宇宙時空都可以到
For example, maybe you're
interested in the outer space.
You can use this.
You can ask the Spiral Light,
and your consciousness goes to
outer space to see maybe Saturn,
Mars, Moon, Mercury, even further.
You can go really really far.
You need to have the Spiral Light.
Because our imagination and
our knowledge is so limited,
they are so huge wide and far more than
we have studied.
We need to have these light bodies,
which contains all the knowledge,
all the wisdom of the entire universe,
or different universes,
if I can say that?
因為祂超越了物質
超越了你的觀念，超越你的想像
所以祂表達出來的
有時候超越你想像的
Because it's far beyond your imagination
Sometimes if it shows something
maybe you've never thought of,
just follow it.
Everything will be very.. how can I say..
Transcend beyond our
imagination and understanding.
你是學物理的，超越你的物理定律
You're a physicist, right?
Sometimes, it can transcend the law of physics.
Can you understand that?
因為祂本身就是沒有空間
Because there is no space, so it can
transcend all the laws of physics.
沒有空間，瞬間都可以
這就是真正照見
「無古今、無始終、無內外、無遠近」
No space and no time, so
you can go there, just like I said...
It's like 'teleportation.'
You just go to different spaces and...
（Nat：Because the space system is holographic.）
Oh, yeah.瞬間也可以...
比如剛才那個伯利恆
伯利恆的星星
伯利恆的星星那個
古代的
古代，有空間有距離
瞬間就在你面前
現在出來了，在你面前
This is the principle that Ben-Zun now is
showing the story of Jesus
in the bible, while the doctors
could see the star （The Star of Bethlehem).
Because that was different time and space
from here, but why we can see it?
Use this light to illuminate
make this scenario.
To make what was happening in the story or
what actually happened there
to show up for us to see
Because this light contains
this kind of function,
And then once our consciousness
connects to it,
we are able to share the feeling
and everything in the universes.
祂沒有定律，沒有規則
There is no rules，沒有科學的法則
No restrictions.所以叫做超越
So, that's why,
it's called transcendence.
你說為什麼這樣？
因為我們的法性就是這樣
就有這種功能和光明體的體性相應
It's naturally just like this. It's
'無所不能'omnipotent
Our consciousness is like origin...
（Huo：Pure potential.）
Your potential. For our saying...
we say original consciousness.
Our origin is omnipotent.
這個要靠我們的potential
潛能，靠我們的本心去相應的
There are so many things in the outer
space or in different universe.
Only we can use our mind and
our consciousness to touch, to feel.
This is the only way.
Maybe our technology
or science is so developed,
but feels limited.
（Nat：Mediated） Oh, yeah.
（Nat：as opposed to direct.）
yeah.
因為我們的知識，只限於人生
自己的規律...
法性流露和意識交合的話
就產生這種功能出來
potential才能展現出來。
Ben-Zun uses the word "法性",
maybe a little bit buddhist.
It's called our "divinity."
or just like our potential.
We have our daily life
because we get educated.
We have our knowledge and
our experiences.
Everything is included in our knowledge,
but in our potential or divinity,
it contains all the wisdom
we've never discovered.
But once we can cooperate with it,
we can share
the wisdom and understanding
the entire universes.
That's what Ben-Zun said.
這些理論簡單
在柏拉圖也有談到
柏拉圖的形象論，這個是copy
剛才五博士還有星星copy過來
柏拉圖叫複製
他有形象論，理型、觀念
觀念、形象copy，他這樣copy過來
他認為柏拉圖的神，把宇宙萬物
落在眼前的空間，就這個道理
Now, Ben-Zun is talking about the ancient
Greek philosopher, Plato.
Plato had a theory that Plato's God can
move all the
the things in the universe, and
put them in front of us.
It's called "Demiurge."
Do you know "Demiurge"?
Plato's God, anyway, can copy everything.
So, that's why Plato said there's an "idea."
We have idea, when we are thinking about
something, this is idea.
And the "ideal" is something
Plato dug into,
because "idea" and "ideal"
were similar to him.
Once we have an "idea" or "ideal" world,
It's like you can have an ideal kingdom.
Everything is from your
imagination. But we can copy
like at the beginning, like Ben-Zun's cup.
In Plato's word, it's called "copy."
You can copy something and place into your
spiritual universe. You can just copy to it
and you can share. So they used the
word "participation."
But actually it just shares it...
copy，比如說
這盆花忽然間在你前面
Now, you can see the flower just...
擺在你前面，here
你們幾個人的前面
You can see the flower, that flower,
identical one, copied to here.
Plato's theory...
Copy萬物
Ben-Zun use the word 'copy' just do it...
（Nat：Use the word you know.）
你的自見其身也可以copy.
duplicate.
他的自見其身也可以copy
你的自見其身，現在的服裝
So, you can copy yourself,
just like duplicate yourself,變三個
you can see three of yourself, until just
now we were practicing one of your energy body.
Now you can see three of them.
Identical one.
三個你，三個他
Can you see three of you, yourself?
three, three.
（Nat：Too many me.）
自見其身可以，也是copy
copy這個分三個，分五個也可以
Now become five, you can see five,
each of them is that clear enough?
Is it clear? 清楚嗎？
Can you see that clear?
Vividly..five of them.
Yeah, five of you, just identical one, just..
有，她說清楚
Can you see it clearly ?
（Nat：OK.）Okay.
而且穿你平常
比如說，以Nat來說
五個你穿平常，你的衣服
喜歡的衣服，五種不同
You can change into different outfits.
You can have five different dresses,
So you can see five of yourself right?
You can wear different dress for each of them.
Each one is your favorite.
In case you haven't noticed,
the dresses are your favorite.
You can wear casual clothing one day,
or mountain-climbing gear the next.
他們有，都穿不一樣
這是所謂柏拉圖的copy
Ben-Zun says we can use "copy"
in Plato theory,
Ben-Zun demonstrates. Because for Plato,
it's just in theory, theoretically
Plato was not able to
demonstrate like this.
But, now Ben-Zun is trying to explain
and borrow the theory from Plato,
and try to demonstrate for you guys
to actually practice it.
這個功能，來自於你的本心
This is from your original...
potential?
Pure potential or we say
original mind.
這是識變，這是意識變現
I need to say that because we use
different words sometimes "original mind,"
"original conscious," "Dharma" or
"divinity". Actually,
They are different words in
different cultures
but sometimes they mean the same thing.
所以你的自見其身，也可以
叫你的名字，你都聽得很清楚
Now you can see still
five of them or one of them?
Can you see it again? Five of them.
Can you do it again?
Now he is calling your name.
You can hear that, is your name.
（有，都有）都可以，都可以哦？
也可以知道，你家人
都知道，你的家人 Also your
family members showed up.都站在前面了
都站在前面
All of your family members
You can see your relatives
and your family members with you.
You can see entire family just like this,
you can hear them calling your name.
For example, maybe your parents may call
your nickname or you can hear...
甚至你的朋友都站出來
Also,...比較好的也站出來了
some of your best friends are
also showed up and appeared.
Your closed friends. Maybe one
or two are here? Yeah? （Nina：Yes.）
（都有）甚至他們的名字
自己打出來，浮出來
You can see their names printed out
雕刻的很漂亮
just like carved. You can see their names.
Maybe just right here.
For example, you can see your friend,
her name or his name...
just showed up here.
可以？（okay?）他們可以哦？
（都可以）可以哦？
不只在這裡，一樣
無所不到，現在我講金字塔
看過去金字塔就在那個
五個朋友就這些（家人都在）
都能看到，各看各的都在
Now you can see the pyramid.
Ben-Zun now is practicing the pyramid.
Your family members are standing
just in front of the pyramid.
Maybe standing at the square
in front of the pyramid.
Or can you see the pyramid in the Egypt?
金字塔 And your family members.
金字塔有看到
（金字塔跟家人朋友，他們都有看到）
家人有看到嗎？（那剛家人朋友）
一起搬過去金字塔那裡，他們都有看到
他們都有看到哦？（有）
金字塔
光打你們個人的名字，比如說找一個
Ｎat好了
金字塔的面有看到哦？
你看，那個火球
打他的名字出來，在金字塔上
火球（火球，OK）
Now, you can see the pyramid from
different surfaces, you can see
this side is facing you. You can see
there's a fireball just hits the pyramid.
And then you can see your name just came up,
The fireball just like a dot
and then you can see your
name was carved by the fireball.
（Nat：Wow）Also, your name.
Can you see it?
甚至你所有朋友的名字
You can see the fireball
just hits the pyramid continuously,
and then you can see your name. 祂都知道
（都有，他們都有）
他們都可以就對了（對）
無所不到
這個是你本體的功能
This is the function of your original mind,
這不是我的功能
是他們自己本心的功能
Not Ben-Zun's function.
This is the function of your
original mind or your pure potential.
Now, everything is your function.
這是你的功能 Now is yours.
因為你有這一顆了
因為你有意識流就可以
Because you realize you have the flow of
consciousness, you have this orb.
So, every function now is yours right now,
not Ben-Zun's anymore. It's yours.
So, you can do it by yourself.
At the beginning maybe Ben-Zun can
do this, maybe we cannot do this,
but now Ben-Zun is trying to mention that
now you guys can do this,變一杯給你喝
everything by yourself.
It's just like your original
consciousness.也可以自己飛過去
Ben-Zun uses "copy"
直接喝下去，同等味道
Also, we can "absorb". These all functions
are now becoming yours.
Once you encounter the light, they
just become yours.
So, this is the amazing part of this.
所以種種變化，有時候出自於你的本心
你的 potential.
你們的距離現在很近
你的本心給它拉開很遠
這個地忽然間，很…
房子忽然間很寬 our physical distance
Just like this, so now Ben-Zun tries...
you can use your potential,
your original mind.
Becomes really really far...
這個空間拉開很開了
now you can see me like really really far.
It becomes distant.
本心滋潤以後
以後你想演什麼、做什麼都十分
現在五分、六分沒有關係
Now, can you feel the distance actually
is really long or still overlap?
（Sherry：It's not physical body. ）
（It's energy body doing those functions.）
（Nina：yeah.）（柏：Can you do that?）
（Don't over trust your eyes. Trust the inside.）
（沒有，她剛剛一開始她說拉不遠）
（她聽不太懂為什麼，什麼是要拉遠）
（她沒有這個概念，什麼叫做）
（把距離拉遠然後又拉不遠）
現在有了嗎？
（但是實際上是，在意識裡面）
（可以拉遠之後）這個是妳的功能
妳的potential表達出來的
妳要自己會，跟我討論這件事
最後要回歸妳自己會
The reason we have a discussion with
Ben-Zun here 她還不知道我的意思
is to get this kind of understanding,
once you go back to your country,
go back to your home, you will be able to
do this all by yourself, so this is
the main reason why we have a discussion
today. Ben-Zun is trying so hard to
teach that you can do this.
能這樣，她會了嗎？（可以了）
你可以把這間房子都變黃金
牆壁變翡翠綠色都有
Now, you can... 可以這樣，就可以這樣
We have this conference room and
it's made by bricks or concrete.
But, now suddenly 讓祂變化、改變物質
everything is made by gold.
You can see that everything is made by
gold and very luxurious.
（Nina：OK, thank you）
Can you see that?（柏：can be replaced）
也可以一直存在 Use your
只要你的程度夠 inner mind
or potential可以設定不能消失
whatever you call this.
Not with this physical consciousness,
You shift to the other one.
你的程度夠的話，到時間
你可以設定五個小時或一直存在
the more you practice
or you get really familiar with,
you can make this room that
made by gold lasting for five hours
or ten hours. So, you will actually feel
you're in a room that made by gold.
你有辦法嗎？這樣可以嗎？
那這樣的話，桌子也變黃金
Now this table becomes gold,
now it's golden table here.
這樣有辦法？Sorry?
（Nina：the gold？）Gold. Sorry for that.
Golden table.
Now, it's a golden table. Table也變黃金，
牆壁什麼也變黃金 The golden wall,
golden ceiling. Can you
see the ceiling becomes gold everywhere?
Even the decoration becomes gold.
那也可以變狹窄
Also, this can be narrow.
牆壁這樣圍過來了 If you can make
it wider, you can make it narrow.
移到你前面，狹窄，移過來 Now, you can
feel the wall is approaching you,
you feel you're pressed.
（Huo：squeezed by the wall）
Some scenes in the scary movie,
but the walls
are coming approach you
and feeling the press.
卡住這樣 Could you feel?
定身法就是這樣，可以把你卡住
現在拉開恢復原狀了
They go back to... 現在桌子
你坐的椅子、桌子都浮起來
頂到天花板
Now, the table starts to float...
頭頂到天花板
You can feel the table
and the chair..好像壓到頂部
壓到頭，壓到天花板頂上
You're sitting on the chair,
but the chair is starting to float,
You'll feel “I will somehow hit the ceiling.”
“My head will hit the ceiling.”
這個是浮起來
可以這樣 You can feel like it's
floating. 這個是用你的本心做的
all of these are made by original mind,
original consciousness, or
original potential. Pure potential. Sorry.
everything just from there.
也就是你的自見其身和你的交流
This is the interaction with
your energy body,
just use your flow of consciousness.
那叫什麼？Pure potential, okay.
做這個的目的，演練這個的目的
是要和你的自見其身交流
然後了解自見其身
以祂的潛能來讓你用得到
The reason of Ben-Zun practicing this
for you guys is to make you guys
understand your energy body better.
The more you understand,
the better you can cooperate with it,
and then you can start to interact, interaction.
You will have better
interaction with your energy body.
So this is the main purpose
Ben-Zun recited again.
你在我照片中可以看到，你能這樣
金字塔也可以蓋住你
你在我照片上看到金字塔
你在金字塔裡面
現在我們上面那個金字塔
你現在看到金字塔
The pyramid now...
瞬間金字塔把我們蓋住了
Just shows up again. The pyramid
just crushed our..
把他擠住了，你覺得身體…
你的手都不能動了 Just like you...
你的手都被擠壓了
inside the pyramid.
在裡面你都不能擠，Tomb, okay.
不能再動了
（他還看到裡面有墳墓）
有，都有
（他看到金字塔裡面有墳墓）
你看，不能動了
而且不會傷害到你
There is nothing harmful.
So you will be okay and safe.
Relax and practice. you can
see the tombs.
如果你是考古學家
不用那麼麻煩再來挖土
If you were an archaeologist,
you would be able to see the
inside of the pyramid.
You don't need dig.
我的照片有照到，蓋著
沒關係，金字塔離開消失
Now the pyramid is disappeared.
講究瞬間，比如說我們現在能這樣的話
我們現在坐在這裡，瞬間在你家客廳的
You can see all of us 坐在你家
客廳的環境 just in this conference room.
Now, it's in your house, all of us,
all the tables, and everything
are in your house. You can see your house.
The surrounding just like your house,桌子全部
but we are in your house.
可以，祂回來了
然後瞬間你家的桌子
你家的客廳也移到這邊來了
We do this the other way around.
Now your coffee table in your living room,
and your sofa are here. You can see
the coffee table.可以交換、移動
It can be interchangeable,
it can moved and transform.你給祂摸
你摸都是實體的，硬硬的
You can try to use your consciousness
to touch your coffee table or
to touch your sofa.
Just like the exact feeling.
桌子就是桌子
就這樣，瞬間移動
This is called "Teleportation."
跟他講一下，我剛才所要表達的
是介紹你的自見其身
為什麼要自見其身，還有光體的關係
然後產生這個意識流
Now, Ben-Zun said all of these are trying to
introduce your energy body.
The importance of the energy body.
The relationship between your consciousness
and your energy body, and the light body.
This is why Ben-Zun tries to practice.
The more you practice, you will
understand all these things become connected.
好，這樣結束，OK OK
